## Integration with ML Pipeline

The interpretation module integrates seamlessly with the existing ML pipeline:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Uses feature names from the feature engineering pipeline
2. **Model Training**: Works with trained models from the model training module
3. **Validation**: Complements the validation module with explainability
4. **Reporting**: Generates interpretation reports alongside performance reports

## Usage Example

```python
from src.interpretation import InterpretationPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = InterpretationPipeline(
    feature_names=feature_names,
    class_names=['Original', 'Suspicious']
)

# Analyze multiple models
importance_results = pipeline.analyze_multiple_models(
    models_dict, X_test, y_test
)

# Explain predictions
explanations = pipeline.explain_predictions(
    best_model, X_samples, 'BestModel'
)

# Create visualizations
plot_paths = pipeline.create_visualizations()

# Generate insights and report
insights = pipeline.generate_insights()
report_path = pipeline.create_interpretation_summary()
```
