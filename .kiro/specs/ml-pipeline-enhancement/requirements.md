# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing EDA notebook with a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for HP product authenticity classification. The enhancement will add feature engineering, model training, validation, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation capabilities to transform the current exploratory analysis into a production-ready ML system that can classify HP products as "original" or "suspicious/counterfeit".

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to engineer meaningful features from the raw product data, so that I can improve model performance and interpretability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing text features THEN the system SHALL create TF-IDF vectors from product titles and descriptions
2. WHEN processing numerical features THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate scaling and normalization techniques
3. WHEN processing categorical features THEN the system SHALL encode them using appropriate encoding methods (one-hot, label encoding)
4. WHEN creating derived features THEN the system SHALL generate price ratios, text length metrics, and keyword presence indicators
5. IF feature correlation is above 0.95 THEN the system SHALL remove highly correlated features to prevent multicollinearity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to train multiple machine learning models, so that I can compare their performance and select the best approach for HP product classification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL implement at least 3 different algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)
2. WHEN splitting data THEN the system SHALL use stratified train-test split with 80/20 ratio
3. WHEN training THEN the system SHALL use cross-validation with at least 5 folds
4. WHEN handling imbalanced data THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate techniques (SMOTE, class weights)
5. IF training data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide warnings about potential overfitting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to validate model performance using multiple metrics, so that I can ensure the model meets business requirements for accuracy and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating models THEN the system SHALL calculate precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create confusion matrices and classification reports
3. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side performance comparisons
4. WHEN validating THEN the system SHALL use both validation set and cross-validation metrics
5. IF model performance is below 80% accuracy THEN the system SHALL flag the model as requiring improvement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to optimize model hyperparameters automatically, so that I can achieve the best possible performance without manual trial-and-error.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tuning hyperparameters THEN the system SHALL use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
2. WHEN optimizing THEN the system SHALL define appropriate parameter grids for each algorithm
3. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL use cross-validation for parameter evaluation
4. WHEN completing tuning THEN the system SHALL save the best parameters and model performance
5. IF tuning takes longer than reasonable time THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to interpret model predictions and feature importance, so that I can understand what drives the classification decisions and ensure model transparency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is complete THEN the system SHALL generate feature importance rankings
2. WHEN analyzing predictions THEN the system SHALL provide prediction probabilities and confidence scores
3. WHEN interpreting THEN the system SHALL create visualizations of feature importance
4. WHEN explaining THEN the system SHALL identify top features contributing to each prediction class
5. IF model is not interpretable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative explanation methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to save and load trained models, so that I can reuse them for future predictions without retraining.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is complete THEN the system SHALL save the best model using joblib or pickle
2. WHEN saving THEN the system SHALL include model metadata (performance metrics, training date, features used)
3. WHEN loading THEN the system SHALL verify model compatibility with current data schema
4. WHEN predicting THEN the system SHALL use the loaded model for new data classification
5. IF model file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to generate comprehensive model evaluation reports, so that I can document model performance and share results with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate PDF or HTML reports
2. WHEN reporting THEN the system SHALL include model performance metrics, visualizations, and feature analysis
3. WHEN documenting THEN the system SHALL provide model comparison tables and recommendations
4. WHEN sharing THEN the system SHALL create executive summaries with key findings
5. IF report generation fails THEN the system SHALL save individual components separately
